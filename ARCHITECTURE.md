# Architecture

How `@interop/was-react` is laid out: the session state machine, how Login With
Wallet works, the storage and sync layers, and the app-facing facades. For
contribution conventions see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); for
agent-facing rules (toolchain, tests, repo-specific dos and don'ts) see
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Directory map

- `src/config.ts` -- the central `WasAppConfig` + `StoreRegistry` contract: the
  app identity (`appName`, `appOrigin`, `appUrl`), the `{ key, id }` collection
  registry the storage layer routes on, the separate read-only
  `sharedCollections` registry, the `onboarding` knob, the `seedLocal` fixtures
  hook, and the sync/expiry tuning. `validateCollections` and
  `validateSharedCollections` are the fail-closed registry checks the storage
  layer runs before any replica opens.
- `src/grants.ts` -- parses granted zcaps into server URL / space id /
  per-collection routing (`ParsedGrants`), over was-client's own
  `parseSpaceTarget`.
- `src/identity/` -- seed-derived agents (`deriveIdentity`, which enforces the
  32-byte seed rule and yields the identity key-agreement key every encrypted
  collection is read with), the app-key credential (issue/locate/parse), seed
  and descriptor persistence (`createSeedStore`, `createDescriptorCache`), the
  persisted app-session record, and the JSON-LD document loader.
- `src/auth/` -- the relying-party side of Login With Wallet (App Connect):
  CHAPI wrappers, VPR construction, response verification, and the
  login/reconnect orchestration.
- `src/sync/` -- the collection-agnostic RxDB-to-WAS replication core (nothing
  here imports React): replication, doc cipher, LWW conflict handling, the
  `WasSyncPort`.
- `src/storage/` -- the encrypted `LocalStore`, the process-wide store holder
  (`storageManager.ts`, which also resolves the per-install `writerId`), generic
  entity stores, the delegated remote store, the read-only
  `SharedCollectionReader`, the replication bootstrap (`wasSync.ts`), the
  session's encryption-descriptor policy (`descriptorManager.ts`), the sync
  controller, sync status, the rehydrate mechanism, the local-to-connected
  adoption merge (`adopt.ts`), and the public share-URL helper (`publicUrl.ts`).
- `src/session/` -- the session auth store factory (`createAuthStore`): the
  four-state machine described below.
- `src/react/` -- the `WasSessionProvider`, the hooks (`useSession`, `useLogin`,
  `useLogout`, `useClearData`, `useHasLocalData`, `useReconnect`,
  `useSharedCollection`, `useSyncStatus`), and the `defineDocumentApp` facade.
- `src/mui/` -- optional MUI + react-router components (`ProtectedRoute`,
  `ReconnectBanner`, `SyncStatusChip`, and the `LogoutDialog` /
  `ClearDataDialog` / `AdoptDialog` confirmations over `ConfirmDialog`).
- `src/dev/` -- Node-only dev-grant provisioner (`provisionDevGrants`).

## The session state machine

`createAuthStore` (`src/session/authStore.ts`) is a factory rather than a
module-level store: the library cannot bind a store to an app's config, so the
React provider calls it once with the app's `WasAppConfig` and `StoreRegistry`
and shares the returned vanilla zustand store through context. It owns the whole
session lifecycle -- boot, login, the non-CHAPI `connectWithGrants` path,
logout, clear-data, reconnect -- and the open/hydrate/sync ordering.

Four states (`SessionStatus`):

- `boot` -- attempting a zero-popup hot restore. Both successors finish
  open-and-hydrate before this status is left, so "app ready" is exactly
  `status !== 'boot'`.
- `local` -- an encrypted, anonymous-seed replica with no remote. A restore miss
  (or any error during restore) lands here rather than on a dead login screen.
- `connected` -- a wallet-derived identity, parsed grants, running replication.
- `reconnect` -- connected but access expired or revoked; the replica stays
  usable and remote invocations are paused until a re-grant.

### The anonymous local-first replica

`local` is a fully usable product state, not a degraded one. The store mints (or
reloads) a persisted anonymous 32-byte seed in its own IndexedDB database
(`<dbName>-anon`, so it can never collide with a wallet session or a connected
replica), derives an ordinary `IdentityAgents` from it, and opens the same
encrypted `LocalStore` a connected session uses. Epoch-from-birth applies
locally too: with no wallet to provision an encryption descriptor, the app mints
one at the collection's local birth -- a one-epoch roster sealed to the
anonymous identity's key-agreement key alone -- and persists it beside the anon
seed, so a reload decrypts what the previous session sealed. `seedLocal` (an
optional config hook) is called exactly once, only when a brand-new anonymous
replica is created, which is why it never re-runs on reload.

The `onboarding` config knob decides only what the router does with this state:
`'local-first'` renders the app immediately over the anonymous replica
(connecting a wallet is a bonus), `'login-gated'` redirects to the login path
until a wallet is connected. It is read by `ProtectedRoute` and never affects
the store's own transitions -- boot always opens a replica either way. The
default is `'login-gated'`, preserving the historical behavior for apps that do
not opt in.

### Adoption (`adopt: 'merge' | 'leave'`)

Logging in tears the anonymous replica down and opens the connected replica
under the wallet-derived seed. Both keys derive from different seeds, so
envelopes are not portable between the two replicas: adoption is necessarily a
decrypt-and-re-encrypt copy (`src/storage/adopt.ts`).

`adopt: 'merge'` (the default for `login` and for `connectWithGrants`) first
detaches the anonymous replica, then re-derives its identity from the persisted
seed and collects the decrypted payloads through a fresh store handle -- the
ordering is load-bearing: holding the live store and the collect handle at once
would double the open-collection count and trip RxDB's process-wide cap. The
payloads are LWW-merged into the connected replica before its first hydrate and
before sync starts -- so they enter the entity stores by ordinary hydration and
reach the server as ordinary creates -- and the anonymous seed and database are
deleted once the activation lands. The merge policy is per logical uuid and
deterministic: insert when the connected replica holds nothing under that uuid;
otherwise replace only when the adopted payload wins the same
`remotePayloadWins` last-write-wins rule replication runs, with a connected doc
carrying no LWW fields always losing to a stamped adopted one. Adopted payloads
missing `updatedAt` / `writerId` are stamped at adoption time with the session's
resolved `writerId` (read from the same holder the write verbs stamp from), so
the repair carries the same attribution identity as the app's own writes;
payloads that already carry them keep their original values. That
preserve-if-present rule is deliberately unlike the write verbs' fresh-always
one: adoption repairs an edit already made, rather than recording a new one.

`adopt: 'leave'` sets the anonymous replica aside untouched instead; it returns
after a logout. A cancelled or failed login leaves `local` intact either way.
`hasLocalData()` is the check a login screen runs to decide whether to offer the
choice at all (`AdoptDialog` is the shipped affordance).

`logout({ wipe })` returns to a fresh `local`, optionally deleting the connected
replica's database; `clearLocalData()` deletes every database this app wrote
here, mints a brand-new anonymous seed and replica, and drops any persisted
connected session, so clearing while connected fully disconnects (both grades
are enumerated below). `destroy()` tears the live replica down without wiping
the persisted session record, and boot/destroy are serialized through one
promise chain so a React dev-mode remount cannot race two bring-up or teardown
sequences.

### Logout and clear-data wipes

`logout({ wipe })` and `clearLocalData()` share one wipe module
(`src/session/localWipe.ts`), enumerated at two grades:

- Logout, keep data (the default): nothing is removed.
- Logout, erase data (`logout({ wipe: true })`): the connected replica and the
  session store are deleted by name. RxDB's own removal clears each collection's
  table but leaves its IndexedDB database standing, so the wipe deletes those
  shells too. The anonymous replica and the writer id deliberately survive: a
  local-first app keeps working logged out.
- Clear data (`clearLocalData()`): everything this library ever wrote on the
  browser -- both replicas, both seed stores, and the writer id -- leaving the
  browser as it was before first run. On top of the named targets it runs a
  prefix sweep, which also reaps anonymous replicas that earlier versions of
  this library orphaned on the same browser.

The module rests on three rules. Snapshot every target from live state before
deleting anything: the anonymous DID is re-derived from its seed while that seed
still exists, because a name derived after the seed is discarded can never be
reached again. Delete by known name, computed through `dbNameForController`,
rather than relying on enumeration. Treat `indexedDB.databases()` as discovery
and verification, not as the deletion gate, since some engines do not implement
it; what a wipe could not confirm removed is reported on its `unverified` list
rather than counted toward a result that reads clean.

`clearLocalData()` resolves with that report (`LocalWipeReport`), and
`useClearData()` passes it through unchanged.

### `writerId`

The per-install LWW attribution label, resolved once at store creation from
`WasAppConfig.storageKeyPrefix` and exposed as `useSession().writerId`. It is an
unkeyed, clearable, unrecoverable stamp whose only jobs are attribution and
breaking last-write-wins ties -- never an identity. (The keyed client identity
of an (app, user) pair is the app-key credential's subject DID.) `getWriterId`
adopts a value left under the older `<prefix>clientId` key once and removes it,
so an existing install keeps its id.

Stamping is the library's job, not the app's. The resolved id is installed in
the storage manager (`setWriterId`, at store creation and before any replica
opens), and `stampLww` -- the one place a payload's `updatedAt` / `writerId` are
minted -- reads it back through `requireWriterId`, which throws rather than
falling back to a default-prefix resolution that would stamp a second id. The
entity store's persisted write verbs (`insert`, `update`, `upsert`) call it on
every write, always fresh and always overwriting whatever the caller passed: a
fill-if-missing rule would let a hydrated doc's stale `updatedAt` ride a later
edit and lose the conflict. `useSession().writerId` is therefore a display and
debugging affordance; nothing an app writes depends on reading it.
`LocalStore`'s own verbs do NOT stamp -- they are the raw layer the adoption
merge and the sync path write through, both of which own their stamping rules.

## Login With Wallet: the App Connect protocol

Login is a single CHAPI `get`. `buildAppConnectVpr` emits a verifiable
presentation request carrying a `DIDAuthentication` query plus exactly one
`AppConnectQuery`:

- `app: { name, appUrl }` -- `name` is `appName` from `WasAppConfig`, display
  metadata for the wallet's consent surface and never evidence of who is asking;
  `appUrl` is the application's canonical URL, which identifies it among the
  applications served from its origin. It must parse as an absolute URL, must
  carry no fragment, and its origin must equal the attested requesting origin;
  the value emitted is the parsed URL's serialization (`serializedAppUrl` from
  `@interop/wallet-core/request`), so spellings differing only in a default
  port, in percent-encoding case, or in dot-segments do not name distinct
  applications.
- `capabilityQuery` -- one collection-scoped entry per requested collection:
  `invocationTarget` (an invocation target descriptor), `allowedAction`
  (non-empty), and `referenceId`. The entries carry no `controller` (the wallet
  fills it with the app-key subject DID; a public client cannot know a returning
  user's DID in advance, and dropping it is what collapses the flow to one
  round) and no `reason` (the App Connect consent surface supersedes per-grant
  reason strings).

The protocol's normative definition is the App Connect companion spec
(<https://github.com/interop-alliance/app-connect-spec>; local checkout
`../app-connect-spec` -- read `spec.md` there rather than fetching the rendered
version): the `AppConnectQuery`, the app-key credential and its binding rules,
the descriptor vocabulary with its allowed-actions table, and the response
presentation this library verifies.

`domain` is this app's own live browser origin -- the origin the CHAPI mediator
attests to the wallet -- and the `challenge` is a fresh, unpredictable nonce per
request, retained for the response check. `liveOrigin` reads
`window.location.origin` rather than trusting configuration: a configured
`appOrigin` differing from the live origin is warned about and is never used as
the bind. That one string is what the request sends as `domain`, what the
`appUrl` is validated against, and what the returned credential's `origin` claim
is checked against.

### The app-key credential

The wallet finds -- or on first run mints, wallet-side -- the app-key credential
for this (origin, `appUrl`) pair, delegates the requested capabilities to its
subject DID, and answers with one signed presentation: the credential in
`verifiableCredential`, the grants in the top-level `zcap` array, and a
wallet-provided `appConnect: { firstRun }` member, all added before signing so
the authentication proof covers them.

The credential's vocabulary is fixed and shared by every application:

- `type` is the two-entry array `["VerifiableCredential", "AppKeyCredential"]`,
  in that order (`APP_KEY_TYPE_ARRAY`). Nothing in it is application-scoped.
- `@context` begins with the VC 1.0 context and the hosted App Connect profile
  context `https://w3id.org/byoe/app-connect/v1`, which defines the credential's
  terms as well as the presentation's `zcap` and `appConnect` members. It is
  registered as a static context by `createDocumentLoader` (out of
  `byoe-context`), so verification still needs no network fetch; the signature
  suite appends its own third entry when the credential is signed.
- `credentialSubject` carries `id`, `seed` (32 bytes, base64url without
  padding), `appUrl`, and `origin`. `issuer` equals `credentialSubject.id`, and
  both equal the did:key derived from the embedded seed.

App identity is therefore scoped to the triple (user, origin, `appUrl`): the
same application at two URLs on one origin is two identities, and one URL can
carry only one.

`issueSeedCredential({ seed, origin, appUrl, appName, documentLoader })`
self-issues that credential (used by the dev-grant path; the wallet mints it in
production). The exported names `issueSeedCredential`, `parseSeedCredential`,
and `findSeedCredential` predate the spec's term for the artifact -- read "seed
credential" in an identifier as the spec's app-key credential.

Historical note (pre-0.13 code and data only, nothing here acts on it): before
the `appUrl` profile the request's `app` block carried `credentialType` and
`vocabBase`, the credential's type array carried a third per-app entry, and its
`@context` was an inline term object interpolated from `vocabBase`. None of that
is emitted, accepted, or configurable any more, and `SeedCredentialConfig` is
gone. Recovering such a credential -- re-issuing it in place under the same
seed, since a fresh mint would roll the seed and orphan the identity the app
encrypted its data under -- is wallet-side work in `@interop/wallet-core`, not
this library's.

### Verifying the response

`loginWithWallet` runs the spec's application-side verification in order,
aborting on the first failure:

1. `verifyLoginPresentation` verifies the presentation proof and every embedded
   credential proof through `@interop/verifier-core`, with `registries: []` --
   issuer-registry lookup must not be required, since the app-key credential is
   self-issued by design.
2. The same call makes the proof checks verifier-core does not: every
   presentation-level proof has `proofPurpose` of `authentication`, echoes this
   request's fresh challenge, and carries this app's origin as `domain`.
3. `findSeedCredential({ presentation, appUrl })` locates the credential by the
   `credentialSubject.appUrl` claim alone. The `AppKeyCredential` marker type is
   deliberately NOT required at this step: requiring it would make "the wallet
   returned a credential that is wrong" indistinguishable from "the wallet
   returned nothing", and an application that reads absence as first run would
   answer by minting a second key. No such credential means the
   wallet-unsupported outcome (`WalletUnsupportedError`).
4. `parseSeedCredential({ credential, origin, appUrl })` enforces the six parse
   checks, in order: the `type` array includes `AppKeyCredential`;
   `credentialSubject.appUrl` equals the `appUrl` this request sent, as an exact
   string; `issuer` and `credentialSubject.id` are both present and equal;
   `credentialSubject.origin` equals this app's own live origin, as an exact
   string; `credentialSubject.seed` is a non-empty string decoding as
   base64url-no-pad to exactly 32 bytes (fail closed, never truncate or pad);
   and the DID derived from those bytes equals `credentialSubject.id`. The
   derived `IdentityAgents` come back on the result so the login flow does not
   re-derive them.
5. `checkGrants` validates the grants against the connecting DID parsed in step
   4 -- never against a DID taken from the response.

These checks duplicate checks the wallet already made; that is the point. They
are defense in depth over an origin binding and an identity binding this app is
fully able to check itself.

The presentation's holder DID is never checked against anything. It may be any
resolvable DID, including one that is ephemeral and not stable across visits.
Application identity does not depend on it: it is the app-key credential's
subject DID, which the wallet custodies. A reconnect therefore returns the same
subject DID, and so the same derived X25519 recipient key, even for an account
with no durable clients of its own.

The marker type is a self-declaration, not evidence -- a planted credential
controls its own `type` array -- so the seed-to-subject binding is what
authenticates internal consistency, and the wallet's store-time refusal (app-key
credentials are wallet-minted, never imported) is what keeps foreign credentials
out in the first place.

The `login()` outcome contract is `{ firstRun }` / `null` / reject:
`appConnect.firstRun === true` is the only value read as first run (an absent
member, a non-boolean, or `false` all mean returning); a null CHAPI response is
a user cancel (`LoginCancelledError`); a verified presentation with no app-key
credential is `WalletUnsupportedError` (fail closed, "update Freewallet" copy).
`LoginPhase` is `'connecting' | 'verifying'`.

### Grant checks and the skip condition

`checkGrants` enforces that every grant's `controller` is the connecting DID,
that each carries an unexpired `expires`, that each `invocationTarget` is a
single non-empty string parsing under the WAS URL template and naming a
collection (never the Space itself or a reserved sub-endpoint), that the whole
set resolves to one host and one Space, and that every app-owned collection the
app requested is covered with the actions it requires.

`checkGrantsForCollections` (`src/auth/loginFlow.ts`) wraps it with one skip:
when the configured app-owned `collections` list is empty AND the response
carries no grants, `checkGrants` -- which rejects an empty grant set -- is
skipped, and an empty grant set with a far-future expiry is returned instead.
That covers both the app that requests nothing at all and the shared-only app
(`collections: []` plus some `sharedCollections`) whose user declined every
share; the declined shares are warned about, and the readers are simply not
opened. Shared collections are never passed to `checkGrants`: a declined share
is not a login failure. They still reach the routing table through
`parseGrants`.

That check is structural. `controller` must equal the app's own DID,
`invocationTarget` must name exactly one collection, and `expires` must be in
the future. Nothing about the delegation chain leading to the grant is
inspected: chain depth, the parent capability, and the delegator's DID form are
deliberately left unchecked. A wallet may root a grant at the Space root or at
an intermediate delegation. Both are valid here. A standing-credential account's
grants, for instance, chain through a generation delegation: the chain is depth
3, and the delegator is a key that never appears in the account document.
Validity at invocation is the storage server's decision, not this library's.

One consequence follows directly: the connected account may have no durable
wallet clients at all. A grant can stop verifying before its stated `expires`,
because the annex generation it chained through was collected. That surfaces as
a 401 or 403, and the session moves to `reconnect`. A collection can also sit on
a key epoch this app cannot open, because no login-time sweep ran to repair it.
A shared collection degrades with a warn-and-skip. An app-owned collection
degrades further: with no epoch roster at all it falls back to a fail-closed
placeholder cipher and only that collection is unusable, but a roster that lists
epochs and excludes this app fails the whole connected activation and lands the
session back in `local` (see "Storage and sync" below). None of these is a raw,
unhandled error.

### Allowed actions

Each request stays within the allowed actions of the descriptor class it uses
(the spec's normative "Allowed actions" table). Both collection classes --
`https://w3id.org/byoe#private-collection` and
`https://w3id.org/byoe#public-collection` -- allow the full vocabulary
`GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE` (`RW_ACTIONS`, in table order), since published
content is still the application's own data and un-publishing and revision are
data management like any other write. A share is read-only (`SHARED_ACTIONS`,
`GET` and `HEAD`).

The exported helper is named `actionCeiling(visibility)`; read "ceiling" as
local shorthand for the class's allowed-actions row. A configured action set
naming an action outside its class's allowed actions is a configuration error
thrown at request-build time -- a conformant wallet can never grant it, so
letting it ride would surface later as a failed login instead of as the config
bug it is. A request that would end up with no actions is likewise refused,
because an empty `allowedAction` array means every action in the zcap model.

The seed never transits a server: minting happens in the wallet, delivery is the
browser-direct CHAPI channel. Dev mode bypasses the credential entirely rather
than faking one -- `provisionDevGrants` (Node only) derives a throwaway
provisioner identity standing in for the wallet, creates the Space and the
requested collections the way a wallet provisions them (a private collection
declared `edv` with its epoch zero installed to the app's identity key-agreement
key; a public one left plaintext), and delegates per-collection zcaps to the
app's controller DID, which `connectWithGrants({ seed, grants })` then adopts
directly. `issueSeedCredential` stays exported for app-side or test
self-issuance of the same credential shape.

## The three kinds of collection

Three kinds, and the distinctions are load-bearing:

- App-owned private (`collections`, `visibility: 'private'`, the default). The
  app provisions, writes, and replicates it. Encrypted with the app's identity
  X25519 key-agreement key -- the same key a shared collection's roster entry
  names. Requested with the `https://w3id.org/byoe#private-collection`
  descriptor. It can answer equality queries too, over the blinded-index
  profile, when it was provisioned with a blinded-index key.
- App-owned public (`collections`, `visibility: 'public'`). Plaintext and
  world-readable; no key derivation, and the stored resource id IS the payload
  uuid, so a public document has a stable share URL (`publicUrlFor`). Requested
  with `https://w3id.org/byoe#public-collection`. The LWW bookkeeping fields
  (`updatedAt`, `writerId`) are world-readable alongside the content.
- Shared, wallet-owned (`sharedCollections`). One of the WALLET's own encrypted
  collections that the user chooses to let this app read and decrypt. Requested
  with `https://w3id.org/byoe#shared-wallet-collection` and the read-only
  `SHARED_ACTIONS` set. It is read-only by construction: no RxDB collection, no
  local replica, no replication, no writes, and the sync bootstrap's
  collection-description PUTs skip it. Reads go straight to the server through a
  `SharedCollectionReader`, which fetches the stored EDV envelope raw (the
  `encryption: 'plaintext'` handle override) and decrypts it locally.

`SharedCollectionReader.list()` has two paths. The fast one pages the `changes`
feed -- whole pages of documents with their bodies, undecrypted by the server,
which is exactly what a reader holding its own keys wants, and the same
primitive replication pulls with. It costs one request per page rather than one
per resource, and skips tombstones so the result is the live set. The fallback,
for a backend without the `changes-query` feature (501, surfaced as
`NotImplementedError`), lists the resource summaries and fetches each body; it
warns once per reader that the collection is being read the slow way.

`validateSharedCollections` rejects a collection declared in both registries: a
collection cannot be app-owned and shared read-only at once.

### One key identity

A share hands the app an entry in the collection's key-epoch roster, and the key
in that entry is the app's identity KAK -- the X25519 (Montgomery) twin of its
`did:key` controller, on `IdentityAgents.keyAgreementKey`. The wallet derives
the same key from the controller DID alone, so the key never travels on the wire
and no request can pair controller DID A with recipient key B.

That is the SAME key the app's own collections are encrypted with. One rule
holds everywhere: an epoch-roster recipient is the X25519 twin of a controller
did:key, whoever owns the collection, and an app derives its key exactly once
per session (`LocalStore.init` takes it, rather than deriving per collection).

Earlier versions ran a second identity for app-owned collections -- a
per-collection KAK, HKDF-derived from the master seed under the collection id
(`deriveCollectionKeys`, label `kak:v1:<collectionId>`). Unifying gives up that
HKDF domain separation: one key now reads every collection the app touches. The
trade is deliberate. A share is also grantable to an arbitrary `did:key` where
no app seed exists at all, so the recipient must be derivable from the
controller DID alone; per-collection keys cannot cover that case, and only the
identity KAK can be the single rule. And the separation bought less than it
appears to: with key epochs the KAK only unwraps an epoch secret rather than
being the content key, and the seed both keys derive from is persisted in the
same process anyway.

### Failing closed, and the honest ceiling

`https://w3id.org/byoe#shared-wallet-collection` is a distinct descriptor type
rather than a flag, for the same reason `#public-collection` is: an unknown type
already resolves to unsatisfiable, so a wallet that predates the feature refuses
visibly. Silently degrading matters more here than elsewhere -- a share fuses
the read zcap with the roster entry, and half a share is ciphertext the app
cannot decrypt, which reads as corrupt data rather than as a wallet needing an
update.

What a share actually covers: every encrypted collection carries a key epoch
from provisioning (epoch zero, wrapped to the wallet owner as recipient zero),
so a share is always an `addRecipient` that escrows this app into every existing
epoch -- no rotation, no lazily created first roster. A new reader therefore
decrypts the collection's contents as they already stand, not only what is
written after the share, which is what the wallet's consent surface states. A
descriptor with no epoch roster at all is refused fail-closed at open
(`SharedCollectionUnavailableError`) rather than seeded here: it can only mean
an unprovisioned or torn collection, and the same error covers a roster this app
is not in (never shared, or access removed -- removal rotates the epoch off this
app's key). Once a session is already open, that same removal surfaces per
envelope as `KeyUnwrapError`: the descriptor lists the epoch, this app just
holds no key for it, so no descriptor refresh is spent on it.

The residue is pre-epoch legacy envelopes: resources sealed as single-recipient
envelopes back when the collection had no epoch roster at all. Nothing
re-encrypts them, so they genuinely do not decrypt for a later reader. They are
skipped with a warning rather than treated as corruption, alongside the other
expected non-results (a body that is not an EDV envelope; an envelope left
unreadable after the reader has spent its one descriptor refresh; an envelope
whose listed epoch this app has no key for, which is what a mid-session revoke
looks like). Every other failure -- no covering grant, no identity key supplied,
not a recipient -- degrades one reader with a warning and never the session.

The other standing limit is the one the wallet states too: removing access stops
future reads but cannot take back what has already been read.

## Storage and sync

`startWasSync` (`src/storage/wasSync.ts`) is the replication bootstrap: given
the parsed grant set and the invoking `ZcapClient` it builds the delegated
`WasRemoteStore`, and then, per registered collection the grants actually cover,
reads the collection description once and uses it twice -- to rebuild that
collection's cipher when its epoch roster differs from what the local store
opened with, and as the read-before-write guard on the best-effort encryption
descriptor PUT. Public collections skip the encryption half. Every collection
that configures equality `indexes` then declares them, and where the declaration
lives depends on the visibility: a public collection announces them in its
plaintext collection description, while a private one declares them as
blinded-index attributes in its own encrypted metadata, through a
compare-and-swap write (`declareBlindedIndexes`, over was-client's
`Collection.declareIndex`). The encrypted form is what lets every recipient
discover what is queryable while the server never learns the attribute names.
Only attributes missing from the persisted schema are written, so a returning
session writes nothing. After the declaration, the bootstrap reads the
collection's stored `/meta` value raw (the opaque encrypted metadata envelope;
`Collection.meta()` would decode it, and the cipher wants it as stored) and
installs the persisted blinded-index schema on that collection's own document
cipher (`LocalStore.applyCollectionMeta`, over the upstream cipher's
`applyMeta`), so every document the app writes from then on carries blinded
`indexed` entries and is findable by an equality query. The install is
remembered per collection and re-applied whenever the cipher is rebuilt (an
epoch rotation, the unknown-epoch refresh): a schema change rotates no epochs,
so the schema deliberately does not ride the descriptor-equality gate. The
residue is prospective-only stamping -- a document sealed before the schema was
installed (anything written offline before the first connect, including the
adoption merge's pre-sync writes) carries no entries until it is rewritten. All
of it is non-fatal and warns on refusal, including a private collection
provisioned without a blinded-index key (no `hmac` member on its descriptor),
which also skips the meta read outright: an unqueryable collection still
replicates in full. The remote store is built with this app's identity keys when
they are available, which is what lets the client's EDV keystore construct the
codec the blinded-index verbs need; replication itself still moves envelopes
verbatim and never goes through that codec. A private collection whose
descriptor carries no key epochs stays fail-closed, warned about plainly rather
than surfacing later as per-row decrypt failures. The fetched descriptors are
handed to `onDescriptorsFetched` (the offline descriptor cache) and a live
descriptor source is installed on the local store, so a decrypt that meets an
unseen epoch (a rotation elsewhere) re-reads and rebuilds once per collection
per session. An unseen epoch is the only signal that spends that refresh; a
decrypt that fails because this app holds no key for an epoch the descriptor
already lists surfaces as `KeyUnwrapError` and leaves the refresh untouched.
Shared collections are handled apart from all of that: they never enter
replication and never receive a description PUT, and instead one
`SharedCollectionReader` is opened per configured shared collection the grants
cover, concurrently, each failure a warn-and-skip.

`readRemoteDescriptors` is the login-time counterpart: one descriptor read per
granted private collection BEFORE any replication exists, because the connected
replica must open epoch-aware -- epoch-from-birth leaves no single-key fallback,
and the adoption merge writes into it before sync starts. Both it and the
bootstrap's per-collection pass run the same read-filter sequence, written once
in `wasSync.ts`: skip the public and ungranted collections, read each remaining
collection's description exactly once (reusing one the caller already read), and
keep only the epoch-bearing descriptors. The bootstrap hangs its own
per-collection work off that pass, so the description PUTs and the cipher
rebuild ride the same single read.

A descriptor's epoch roster can also simply not include this app: not "no
descriptor" and not "no epochs", but a roster whose recipients never wrapped a
key to this app's key-agreement key at all. That is a different failure from the
ones above. Building that collection's cipher raises `KeyUnwrapError` from
inside `LocalStore.init`, and it is not absorbed per collection the way a
missing descriptor is. The connected activation fails as a whole, and the
session falls back to `local` with the error surfaced. It never dead-ends: the
anonymous replica is what it lands on.

`createDescriptorManager` (`src/storage/descriptorManager.ts`) owns where a
descriptor comes from at each point of a bring-up, bound once to the app's
collection registry and its two seed stores. It mints and persists the anonymous
replica's descriptors at local birth, reads the offline cache before any remote
exists, completes that set with live reads for a granted private collection the
cache does not cover, and writes the sync bootstrap's fetched set back. The auth
store only sequences those four operations. Each is best-effort in the same way:
a failure warns and leaves the affected collections fail-closed rather than
failing the session.

`createDescriptorCache` (`src/identity/seedStore.ts`) presents the seed store's
single persisted descriptor record as the `EncryptionDescriptorCache` seam
`@interop/wallet-core/descriptors` acquires through. The blob is stamped with
the controller DID whose descriptors it holds, and a cache bound to a different
controller reads it as empty and overwrites the stamp on its first write: a
descriptor names an epoch roster a specific identity is a recipient of, so a
login under another controller must never build ciphers from it. Puts are
read-modify-writes over the one record, serialized through a promise chain so
two of them cannot lose one another's entry. The cache is a superset of that
seam: it also reads the whole set in one blob read and merges a whole set in one
read-modify-write, so a bring-up phase costs one IndexedDB open/close instead of
one per collection.

The root entry also re-exports `mintRecordEncryption` (from
`@interop/wallet-core/keyring`) beside `LocalStore`, `deriveIdentity`, and
`createDescriptorCache`. The seam rule: a consumer handed `LocalStore` directly
is handed everything needed to provision one under epoch-from-birth -- minting
the one-epoch descriptor a fresh encrypted collection requires must not force a
dependency on `@interop/wallet-core`. It is the same minting the anonymous
replica and this package's own tests use.

`publicUrlFor({ collectionKey, id })` (`src/storage/publicUrl.ts`) composes the
stable, world-readable resource URL of a document in a public (plaintext)
collection -- the publish-copy share pattern. It routes the logical key to its
WAS collection id through the same process-wide holders `EntityStore.query`
uses, so it needs an open `LocalStore` and a wallet-connected session, and it
fails closed on a non-public or unprovisioned collection or an empty id. The URL
resolves publicly only once the document has replicated.

`createDocumentLoader` (`src/identity/documentLoader.ts`) is the app's one
JSON-LD document loader: `@interop/security-document-loader`'s static security
contexts and its default did:key + did:web resolver, plus the
`@interop/did-method-webvh` driver, so a wallet may present its presentation
holder as a did:webvh and verification still resolves it -- as VERIFIED
resolution, with the driver's history-log verifier (hash chain plus entry
proofs) active, so a tampered `did.jsonl` fails closed. The BYOE App Connect
contexts are registered as static documents from `byoe-context`, which is what
keeps verification fetch-free and lets vocabulary additions ship with a
`byoe-context` bump alone. DIDs on loopback hosts resolve over plain http
natively, so no dev shim is needed.

## The one-document facade

`defineDocumentApp` (`src/react/documentApp.ts`) builds the whole wiring --
config, store registry, entity store -- for an app whose entire model is a
single key-value document (an Excalidraw-style editor, a game save file), and
returns a typed `useAppDocument` hook over it. The app never sees
`createEntityStore`, grant parsing, or sync internals: it renders `doc`, calls
`update`, and optionally offers file export/import (`was-document/v1` tagged
blobs) and a "Save to Web Spaces" `connect()`.

It is a degenerate entity store: one collection holding one logical document
under a fixed id, with the app's data wrapped as
`{ id, updatedAt, writerId, data }` so app fields can never collide with the LWW
fields the sync layer requires -- and stamped by the entity store's `upsert`,
not by the facade, which passes `{ id, data }` alone. Hydration goes through
`LocalStore.hydrateSingleton`, which LWW-reconciles the duplicate envelope rows
two clients can mint for the same logical document, keeping the winner and
tombstoning the losers. The generated config registers exactly one collection
and sets `onboarding: 'local-first'`, so `connect()` is plain `login()`: one
legible line on the wallet consent screen, and the default merge adoption
carries the local document into the granted collection. Multi-document ("slot")
variants are not supported yet (they would need a grouped per-id reconciler --
`hydrateSingleton` reconciles all rows down to one winner), and an app that has
outgrown one document should move to `createEntityStore`.

## The MUI dialogs

Three presentational confirmations over the store's actions, all built on
`ConfirmDialog` and all cancel-safe (backdrop, escape, or Cancel runs nothing):

- `LogoutDialog` makes the keep-versus-wipe choice explicit -- log out but leave
  the local replica on this machine, or log out and erase it -- since a shared
  machine and a personal one want opposite defaults. It states that erasing
  removes the local copy only and that data already synced returns on the next
  login.
- `ClearDataDialog` confirms the destructive reset behind `clearLocalData`. Its
  warning is mode-aware: in `local` the local replica is the only copy, so it
  nudges the user to export first; once connected, the synced copy survives, so
  it says so instead of threatening total loss.
- `AdoptDialog` is the pre-login adoption choice an app shows when
  `useHasLocalData` reports data in the anonymous replica: "Bring my data" runs
  `login({ adopt: 'merge' })`, "Set it aside" runs `login({ adopt: 'leave' })`.
