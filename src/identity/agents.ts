/**
 * WAS master-identity derivation from a 32-byte master seed.
 *
 * SEED-DERIVATION CONVENTION (pinned, part of the shared-key contract): the
 * pinned `@interop/webkms-client` exposes `CapabilityAgent.fromSeed({ seed })`,
 * which takes the raw 32 bytes AS-IS (no hashing). We use it for the master
 * identity, feeding raw bytes -- never `fromSecret`, which salt-hashes a STRING
 * and would derive a different key for a byte array vs its text form.
 *
 * WHAT SELECTS THE KEY (verified against `CapabilityAgent.fromSeed`): the key
 * material is derived from the `seed` bytes (the HMAC key) and the `keyName`
 * string (the HMAC message) alone. The `handle` is stored on the returned agent
 * as a cosmetic identifier and does NOT enter key derivation -- nor the derived
 * did:key id, which is the fingerprint of the seed+keyName key pair. So the
 * PINNED derivation inputs are the seed bytes and the `keyName` value
 * (`IDENTITY_KEY_NAME` below); changing THAT after first use is a data-migration
 * event. The `identityHandle` parameter is safe to change and exists only so an
 * app can supply a label for cosmetic continuity; it does not affect the
 * identity, keys, or any stored data.
 *
 * ONE KEY IDENTITY answers for encryption everywhere: the app's IDENTITY
 * key-agreement key (KAK), derived here as the X25519 (Montgomery) twin of the
 * did:key controller. One per app identity, and the single rule for every
 * key-epoch roster entry -- a recipient is always the X25519 twin of a
 * controller did:key, whether the collection is one the app provisioned or one
 * the wallet SHARED with it. Both sides of a share derive it independently, so
 * it never travels on the wire.
 *
 * Earlier versions used a second identity for app-provisioned collections: a
 * per-collection KAK, HKDF-derived from the master seed under the collection id
 * (`deriveCollectionKeys`, label `kak:v1:<collectionId>`). That derivation has
 * been removed from `@interop/wallet-core/identity`. Unifying cost
 * the HKDF domain separation between collections -- the identity KAK now reads
 * every collection the app touches. In the multi-recipient model that key only
 * unwraps an epoch secret rather than being the content key, and the seed it was
 * derived from is persisted in the same process anyway, so the separation bought
 * less than it looked like; what it genuinely served -- handing one collection's
 * key to a third party -- is what key-epoch rosters replaced.
 *
 * Not test-node-safe on React Native, but fine under Node/Vitest: the crypto
 * stack (`webkms-client`, `x25519-key-agreement-key`) runs on the standard Web
 * Crypto that Node 24 provides.
