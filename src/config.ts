/**
 * The central configuration contract for a WAS-backed local-first app: the app
 * identity/origin/URL, the registry of storage collections, and the
 * (all-optional) sync/expiry tuning. An app builds one
 * {@link WasAppConfig} and threads it through the auth, storage, and sync
 * layers.
 *
 * A collection is a logical `key` (the app-side / RxDB collection handle) mapped
 * to its WAS collection `id` (the deliberately unprefixed, generic name shared
 * across interoperable apps). The auth layer consumes only the `id`s; this
 * config layer owns the `{ key, id }` registry the storage layer routes on.
 *
 * A SHARED collection ({@link SharedCollectionConfig}) is the other direction:
 * a wallet-owned, already-encrypted collection the app is granted read-and-
 * decrypt access to. It has the same `{ key, id }` shape but none of the
 * replication -- no RxDB collection, no writes, no local replica.
 *
 * The STORE REGISTRY ({@link StoreRegistry}) is the injection seam that replaces
 * the storage-layer's former hardcoded per-entity maps: an app supplies, per
 * collection key, the four handlers the rehydrate mechanism drives (hydrate the
 * whole collection, per-doc upsert/drop of an already-decrypted payload, and
 * clear-on-logout). Expressing each collection as its own set of functions lets
 * an app special-case a singleton collection (e.g. a current-focus doc) without
 * a rigid CRUD interface.
