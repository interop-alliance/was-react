 * WasRemoteStore (delegated-only): the relying-party view of the user's WAS
 * Space, stripped to the RP model -- this app NEVER provisions the Space, never
 * derives the spaceId, and never touches the `id` collection or DID publishing.
 * It receives a set of wallet-delegated zcaps, reads the server URL + space id
 * straight out of their `invocationTarget`s ({@link parseGrants}), and holds:
 *
 * - a `WasClient` wrapping the app's own `ZcapClient` (its invocation signer is
 *   the seed-derived controller the grants were delegated to);
 * - per-collection capability routing, so each sync request invokes the exact
 *   collection grant;
 * - a best-effort encryption-descriptor PUT (whether a delegated collection-scoped
 *   RW zcap authorizes writing the collection description). It is non-fatal
 *   either way -- envelopes replicate into an unmarked (plaintext) collection
 *   just the same. A PUBLIC collection is never marked: public implies
 *   plaintext, so the descriptor PUT is skipped outright;
 * - the sibling best-effort index declarations -- the `indexes` description PUT
 *   for public collections and the blinded-index schema write for private ones
 *   ({@link WasRemoteStore.declareBlindedIndexes}) -- plus the equality query
 *   verb itself ({@link WasRemoteStore.queryCollectionByEquality}), which
 *   routes on the collection's visibility: the canonical sorted
 *   `filter[attr]=value` GET for a public collection, the client-blinded
 *   `blinded-index` query for a private one, both parsed into the same
 *   `{ documents, hasMore, cursor? }` page shape.
