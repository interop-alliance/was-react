/**
 * The session-scoped storage context: everything a session's storage layer
 * shares across its async consumers, bound to one store registry and owned by
 * one session auth store. It holds the open {@link LocalStore} replica, the
 * connected session's {@link WasRemoteStore}, the per-install writer id the
 * write verbs stamp with, the sync status store, and the debounced re-hydrate
 * timers -- the values that used to be module globals, so that two providers
 * in one process no longer clobber each other and a consumer never has to
 * invent its own "did the holder change under me" guard.
 *
 * Staleness is one mechanism, a generation counter: every attach and detach of
 * the replica bumps it. {@link StorageContext.whileAttached} runs an async
 * operation against the replica attached at its start and reports the result
 * only if the same replica is still attached when it settles; the scheduled
 * re-hydrates and the per-doc change patches are built on it. A consumer that
 * outlives its replica therefore ends as a silent no-op rather than as an
 * unhandled rejection or -- worse -- a write into the NEXT session's replica.
