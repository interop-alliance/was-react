/**
 * The app-side seam between the replication driver and `@interop/was-client`.
 * Delegates to the client's own `createWasSyncPort` -- which owns the WAS URL
 * grammar, the verbatim (codec-bypassing) `was.request()` writes, the `changes`
 * feed pull, the key-epoch header, and the conditional-write ETag handling --
 * and pins the two options this library needs: the collection's delegated
 * capability, and `mapAuthErrors` so a `401` / `403` / the server's masked `404`
 * arrive as a `WasSyncAuthError` the sync controller matches by name.
 *
 * What stays here is the narrowing to a `WasSyncBasePort`: the 412 conflict
 * re-read (`get`) is supplied separately by `withFeedPrimaryRead`
 * (`@interop/was-sync/rxdb`), which resolves the primary state from the
 * changes-feed BODY -- origin-independent, unlike a cross-origin `GET` whose
 * ETag header CORS hides.
 *
 * The session binding no longer builds its port through here: the controller
 * core takes the same two options as port flags and calls the client directly.
 * This wrapper stays as the published seam for a consumer driving replication
 * itself.
