/**
 * The local-to-connected adoption merge: copies the anonymous replica's
 * decrypted payloads into the freshly opened connected replica. A copy
 * (decrypt with the anonymous cipher, re-encrypt with the connected cipher) is
 * the only possible mechanism -- the two replicas derive their keys from
 * different seeds, so envelopes are not portable across them.
 *
 * Merge policy, per logical uuid (deterministic, replica-independent):
 * - no connected doc under that uuid: insert.
 * - a connected doc exists: the adopted payload replaces it only when it wins
 *   the same last-write-wins rule replication runs ({@link remotePayloadWins});
 *   a connected doc without LWW fields always loses to a stamped adopted one.
 *
 * Adopted payloads missing `updatedAt`/`writerId` are stamped at adoption time
 * with the session's resolved writer id (the sync layer's conflict resolution
 * requires them); payloads that already carry them keep their original values,
 * so a doc edited long ago does not suddenly outrank fresher remote edits.
 * That preserve-if-present rule is deliberately unlike the entity-store write
 * verbs, which always stamp fresh: this is a repair of an existing edit, not a
 * new one.

 *
 * The rows are written through `LocalStore` directly, which does not stamp;
 * the preserve-if-present / fill-if-missing repair below is deliberate and
