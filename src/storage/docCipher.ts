/**
 * The per-collection EDV document cipher: the local encrypt/decrypt seam. It
 * wraps the same `@interop/was-client` EDV codec the remote WAS handles use,
 * pointed at the local replica: `encrypt` turns a JSON document into its stored
 * EDV envelope (`{ id, sequence, jwe }`) minting a stable random resource id
 * (`idDerivation: 'random'`), and `encryptUpdate` re-encrypts a mutable head
 * document under its EXISTING id, advancing the envelope `sequence` from the
 * prior envelope. `decrypt` reverses it. The sync layer moves the envelope
 * verbatim; it never touches these keys.
 *
 * On a collection whose encryption descriptor declares a blinded-index key, the
 * cipher can also carry the collection's persisted index schema (supplied at
 * build time as `meta`, or installed afterwards through `applyMeta`), so the
 * envelopes it writes carry the same blinded `indexed` entries a direct write
 * through a collection handle emits -- which is what makes a pushed document
 * findable by an equality query.
 *
 * A PUBLIC (plaintext) collection uses {@link createPlaintextDocCodec} instead:
 * the same {@link DocCipher} seam with pass-through implementations, so the
 * storage layer above needs no encrypted-vs-plaintext fork.

/**
 * A per-collection document cipher. `encrypt` is the create path (mints a random
 * envelope id); `encryptUpdate` is the in-place update path (re-encrypts under
 * an existing id, advancing `sequence` from the prior envelope); `decrypt`
 * reverses either, given the resource id the envelope is stored under -- the
 * caller's own row/resource id, not anything read out of the decrypted
 * payload, since the server controls that field -- and raises `IntegrityError`
 * when the envelope does not verify against it. An EDV (key-epoch) cipher also
 * surfaces the `epoch` id it encrypted under, which rides the content push as
 * the `Key-Epoch` header; the plaintext codec returns none.
 *
 * `applyMeta` is the blinded-index schema install hook an EDV cipher exposes:
 * given the collection's stored `/meta` value, it installs the persisted index
 * schema so subsequent writes emit blinded `indexed` entries. It is absent on
 * the pass-through plaintext codec and on the fail-closed placeholder, neither
 * of which has a schema to install -- hence optional here.
 *
 * `decrypt`'s return type is narrower than `@interop/was-client/sync`'s
 * `DocCipher['decrypt']` (`Json` rather than `Json | Blob`): no collection in
 * this repo writes a chunked (binary) document, so a `Blob` result never
 * occurs here. For the same reason the chunked-blob `context` / `spaceId`
 * wiring is left out of {@link createDocCipher}: nothing would call it.
