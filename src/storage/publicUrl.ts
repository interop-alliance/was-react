 * remote-store holder), and fails closed on non-public collections.

 * is stable across edits because a public collection stores the payload under
 * its own logical uuid. Requires an open store and a wallet-connected session,

 * empty id. The URL resolves publicly only once the document has replicated to
 * the server -- a locally-inserted doc shares after the next sync push.
