 * The storage manager: the one remaining process-wide pointer, to the ACTIVE
 * {@link StorageContext}, plus the app-facing facades over it. Entity stores
 * are created at module level, before any session exists, so their verbs
 * cannot hold a context of their own; they reach the live session through
 * {@link requireStore} / {@link requireRemoteStore} / {@link stampLww} here,
 * which resolve to whichever context is active. Keeping the facade free of
 * store imports (no cycle) also lets the session store own the init/hydrate
 * ordering.
 *
 * Activation is deliberate about the two-providers case: a context with a
 * replica attached is live, and a live context is never replaced -- a second
 * session attaching a replica of its own throws instead of silently taking the
 * facades over. A context without a replica (created but not booted, or torn
 * down) is inert and is replaced without complaint, which is what a React
 * dev-mode double `useState` initializer or a test's sequence of stores needs.
