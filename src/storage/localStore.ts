 * LocalStore: the always-on local replica. A GENERIC per-entity envelope store
 * over an app's registered collections. Owns one RxDB (Dexie/IndexedDB)
 * database holding one collection per entity on the shared `syncedDocSchema()`;
 * every at-rest row is `{ id, updatedAt, version, data }`. On a PRIVATE
 * (default) collection `data` is the EDV envelope `{ id, sequence, jwe }` --
 * the server never sees plaintext. On a PUBLIC collection `data` is the
 * plaintext payload as-is, behind the same {@link DocCipher} seam (a
 * pass-through codec), so everything below this paragraph applies to both.
 *
 * Two id planes: the logical entity `uuid` lives INSIDE the encrypted payload;
 * the RxDB primary key is the opaque random EDV envelope id. An in-memory
 * `uuid -> envelopeId` index (built during hydration) routes updates/deletes.
 * (On a public collection the planes coincide -- the row id IS the payload
 * uuid, giving a public document a stable, shareable resource URL -- and the
 * index degenerates to identity.) Two timestamp planes: the row-level
 * `updatedAt` is only the sync checkpoint; the payload's own `createdAt` /
 * `updatedAt` (inside the ciphertext) drive domain sorting and LWW.
 *
 * Writes: create mints a fresh random envelope; update re-encrypts under the
 * SAME envelope id with `sequence`+1 (the mutable-head model); delete is an RxDB
 * soft-delete tombstone.
