/**
 * SharedCollectionReader: a READ-ONLY view over one wallet-owned encrypted
 * collection the wallet has shared with this app (the
 * `https://w3id.org/byoe#shared-wallet-collection` grant). It is the app-side
 * other half of the wallet's share flow, and it is read-only BY CONSTRUCTION --
 * there is no write verb on this class, the collection is never replicated
 * into RxDB, and the sync bootstrap never PUTs a description onto it.
 *
 * A share fuses two axes, and both are needed here:
 *
 * - **pull** -- the delegated `GET`/`HEAD` zcap on the collection, which is what
 *   the server checks at request time;
 * - **read** -- an entry in the collection's key-epoch roster, wrapped to this
 *   app's IDENTITY key-agreement key (the X25519 twin of its did:key
 *   controller, `IdentityAgents.keyAgreementKey`). That is the same key the
 *   app's own collections are encrypted with: one rule for every roster entry,
 *   whoever owns the collection.
 *
 * The stored resource body IS the EDV envelope the wallet's replication moved
 * verbatim, so reads must be RAW: the handle is opened with the
 * `encryption: 'plaintext'` override (the `WasClient`'s own encryption provider
 * is a deliberate no-op keystore) and the envelope is decrypted locally with a
 * cipher built from the collection's `encryption` descriptor.
 *
 * The honest ceiling, the same one the wallet's consent screen states:
 *
 * - access can be removed later, which stops FUTURE reads but cannot take back
 *   what has already been read;
 * - a share escrows this app into every existing epoch, so the collection's
 *   existing contents decrypt too; the one residue is pre-epoch legacy
 *   envelopes (single-recipient, written before the collection had any epoch
 *   roster), which are never re-encrypted and will not decrypt here. That is
 *   expected, not corruption -- they are skipped with a warning.
