/**
 * The session auth store (zustand): a four-state machine
 * (`boot` | `local` | `connected` | `reconnect`) that owns the whole session
 * lifecycle -- boot (hot restore or fall to an anonymous local replica), Login
 * With Wallet, the non-CHAPI `connectWithGrants` path, logout, clear-data, and
 * the expired-access reconnect -- plus the open/hydrate/sync ordering.
 *
 * `boot` attempts a zero-popup session restore. A restore hit opens the
 * encrypted {@link LocalStore} under the session seed, hydrates the entity
 * stores, starts WAS replication, and lands `connected`. A restore miss (or any
 * error) opens the store under a persisted ANONYMOUS seed instead and lands
 * `local`: a fully usable, encrypted, local-only replica with no remote. Both
 * successors finish open+hydrate before leaving `boot`, so "app ready" is simply
 * `status !== 'boot'`.
 *
 * Login (or `connectWithGrants`) tears the anonymous replica down and opens the
 * connected replica under the wallet-derived seed. By default it ADOPTS the
 * anonymous replica's data first (`adopt: 'merge'`): the replica is detached,
 * its decrypted payloads are collected through a fresh handle re-derived from
 * the persisted seed, LWW-merged into the connected replica before its
 * first hydrate/sync (so they reach the server as ordinary creates), and the
 * anonymous seed + database are deleted once the activation lands. `adopt:
 * 'leave'` sets the anonymous replica aside untouched instead (it returns after
 * a logout). Logout returns to a fresh `local` (optionally wiping the connected
 * replica, and leaving the anonymous one in place); `clearLocalData` deletes
 * every database this app ever wrote on the browser, drops the persisted writer
 * id and any persisted connected session, and mints a brand-new anonymous seed
 * and replica.
 *
 * The library cannot bind a module-level store to app config, so this is a
 * FACTORY: {@link createAuthStore} captures the app's {@link WasAppConfig} and
 * {@link StoreRegistry} once (the React provider calls it once) and returns a
 * vanilla zustand store the hooks consume through context.
