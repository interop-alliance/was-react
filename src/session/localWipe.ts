/**
 * The wipe enumeration: the one list of durable local state this library leaves
 * on a browser, and the one executor that deletes it. Clearing data must leave
 * nothing behind, and the failure it exists to prevent is an ORPHANED database
 * -- one whose name is derived from an identity the clear itself destroyed, so
 * no later run can name it, let alone delete it.
 *
 * Three rules keep that from happening:
 *
 * - Snapshot first. Every target is derived from live state BEFORE anything is
 *   deleted ({@link snapshotWipeTargets}), so the order of the deletions that
 *   follow cannot lose a name.
 * - Delete by known name. Each replica's database name is computable from its
 *   controller DID through `dbNameForController`, so it is deleted by that name
 *   whether or not the engine can enumerate databases.
 * - Treat `indexedDB.databases()` as discovery and verification, never as the
 *   deletion gate. An engine that does not implement it still gets every named
 *   database deleted; what it cannot confirm is reported as `unverified` rather
 *   than counted toward an outcome that reads clean.
 *
 * What the prefix sweep reaches beyond the snapshot: anonymous replicas that
 * earlier versions of this library already orphaned, and the replicas of other
 * wallet identities on this browser. Both are this app's own databases under
 * its own `dbName`, and removing them is what clearing data means.
 *
 * What no enumeration here reaches, stated plainly: data already synced to the
 * WAS server (this is a local clear, not an account deletion), forensic
 * recoverability of deleted IndexedDB data, and anything the app itself
 * persisted outside this library.
