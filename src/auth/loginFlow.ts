/**
 * The Login-With-Wallet orchestration: one-popup App Connect.
 *
 * A single CHAPI `get` carries the {@link buildAppConnectVpr} request. The
 * wallet -- in the same round -- matches an existing app key or mints a fresh
 * one (the first-run branch is wallet-internal now), then returns the app-key
 * credential and the delegated zcaps embedded in one signed response VP. So
 * there is no second store popup and no separate grants popup:
 *
 * - Returning: the wallet returns the credential; we recover the seed and
 *   verify its self-issue/origin/DID binding.
 * - First run: the wallet mints the seed, self-issues the same-shaped
 *   credential, and marks `presentation.appConnect.firstRun`.
 *
 * A wallet that predates `AppConnectQuery` cannot satisfy it and returns no
 * app-key credential; that surfaces as {@link WalletUnsupportedError} (fail
 * closed, legibly), distinct from a user cancel (a null CHAPI response).
 *
 * Hot restore (seed + grants already persisted locally) never reaches this
 * module -- the caller's session restore short-circuits it.
